# The Simplest CycleGAN Full Implementation

- Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks

## Requirement

Check the `requirements.txt`

## Run

It will automatically download the data in `data.py`.

```python
python train.py
```

## Distributed Training

GAN-like networks are particularly challenging given that they oftne use multiple optimizers being used in parallel.
To speed up training, we use a novel [KungFu](https://github.com/lsds/KungFu) library.
KungFu is very easy to install and run (compared to the previously used Horovod library
which depends on OpenMPI), and simply follow
the [instruction](https://github.com/lsds/KungFu#install). KungFu is also very fast, compared
to today's Horovod and parameter servers architectures.

In the following, we assume that you have added `kungfu-run` into the `$PATH`.

(i) To run on a machine with 4 GPUs:

```bash
kungfu-run -np 4 python3 train.py --parallel --kf-optimizer=sma
```

The default KungFu optimizer is `sma` which implements synchronous model averaging.
You can also use other KungFu optimizers: `sync-sgd` (which is the same as the DistributedOptimizer in Horovod)
and `async-sgd` if you train your model in a cluster that has limited bandwidth and straggelers.

(ii) To run on 2 machines (which have the nic `eth0` with IPs as `192.168.0.1` and `192.168.0.2`):

```bash
kungfu-run -np 8 -H 192.168.0.1:4,192.168.0.1:4 -nic eth0 python3 train.py --parallel --kf-optimizer=sma
```
